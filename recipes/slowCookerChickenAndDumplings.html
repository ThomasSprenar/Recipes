        </p>

        <h3>Chicken</h3>

        <p>

            Opt for boneless, skinless chicken breast halves.

        </p>

        <h3>Butter</h3>

        <p>

            Butter adds creaminess and richness to this comforting meal.

        </p>

        <h3>Canned Soup</h3>

        <p>

            Two cans of condensed cream of chicken soup make this Crock-Pot chicken and 
            dumplings recipe quick and easy to throw together.

        </p>

        <h3>Onion</h3>

        <p>

            Kick the flavor up a notch with a diced onion. As the chicken and dumplings cook, 
            the flavor will deepen.

        </p>

        <h3>Refrigerated Biscuit Dough</h3>

        <p>

            Instead of making homemade dumplings, 
            try using refrigerated biscuit dough for a convenient shortcut.

            We think this dish is delicious on its own,
